Create the environment from the environment.yml file:
    cd to the github FacialPC folder on the anaconda prompt where the environment.yml file is
    Run:
        conda env create -f environmentv2.yml

    Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
        conda env list
        You can also use conda info --envs.

    Activate the new environment: 
        conda activate FacialPCv2

Due to an error in the Speech Recognition Package:
(https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/issues/334),
    Line 924 of <Anaconda3_Install_Location>\envs\FacialPCv1\lib\site-packages\speech_recognition\__init__.py:
            speech_config["speechContext"] = {"phrases": preferred_phrases}
    needs to be changed to:
            speech_config["speechContexts"] = {"phrases": preferred_phrases}
            
    Note: for me <Anaconda3_Install_Location>=C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3
            
            
A dependency on visual studios requires it be installed:
    Downloaded visual studio:
        https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
    Download c++ build tools:
        https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
        
        
From the github FacialPC folder with the FacialPCv1 env activated, you should now be able to run:
    python main.py
