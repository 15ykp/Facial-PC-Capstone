# Facial-PC-Capstone
This program allows users with physical disabilities such as quadrapalegics to use a commodity machine. By using voice recongnition, facial recongition, and eye classifiers, this program allows users to use voice commands, head tilts, and eye winks to interact with the computer. A demo of the program can be seen in the project demo mp4.
